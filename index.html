            <p> 
            Hey! Hope you're doing awesome, I'm Ben! I am currently enrolled at UCSD as a student in Mathematics - Computer Science, 
            and I have been using my time here to learn as much as I can about programming software. 
            I like to workout, read, practice piano and guitar, and most evidently code.
            If you'd like to see what I'm working on, want to check me out on other websites, or learn more about me then look below. Thanks!
            </p>

            <p> 
            This game started as a final project assignment for a high school class.
            As I got more invested, I ended up developing a demo with my own original sprites, art, story, and of course code.
            You can check out the game for yourself through the link below.

            <jumbo class="big"> ENA Interactive Wallpaper <br /> </jumbo>
            <p>
            After using wallpaper engine for about a year I wanted to make my own interactive 
            wallpaper to contribute to the community. I ended up designing a free one based
            around a web series called "ENA" and it recieved 100+ downloads! It includes a toggle for 
            the date, time, an audio visualizer, and a few different gifs you can cycle through.
