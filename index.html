            <p> 
            Hey! Hope you're doing awesome, I'm Ben! I am currently enrolled at UCSD as a student in Mathematics - Computer Science, 
            and I have been using my time here to learn as much as I can about programming software. 
            I like to workout, read, practice piano and guitar, and most evidently code.
            If you'd like to see what I'm working on, want to check me out on other websites, or learn more about 
            me feel free to check out the links below. Thanks!
            </p>

            This was my team's contribution to the UCSD Video Game Development Club's Spring 2025 Tritonware
            GameJam! I programmed the puzzle mechanics, UI, and scripts for seamless transitions between the
            story and the game itself. I also worked on some of the art, like the background of the photo
            pictured right. If you want to check out the game for yourself you can play it in your browser through
            the link below!

            <p> 
            DataHacks 2025 was a Hackathon hosted by UCSD's Data Science Student Society (DS3).
            In a team of two others, my friends Teo and Arnav, we fed Pokemon Soundtracks
            and their real world counterparts into the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) to
            see how much the composers derived from the real world areas the games are
            based on. I compiled all the soundtracks and music, as well as frontend using streamlit 
            to present our project. You can check out the project with the link below!

            <p> 
            This game started as a final project assignment for a high school class.
            As I got more invested, I ended up developing a demo with my own original sprites, art, story, and of course code.
            You can check out the game for yourself through the link below.

            <p>
            After using wallpaper engine for about a year I wanted to make my own interactive 
            wallpaper to contribute to the community. I ended up designing a free one based
            around a web series called "ENA" which received 500+ unique downloads! It includes a toggle for 
            the date, time, an audio visualizer, and a few different gifs you can cycle through. I also
            recently created a Pokemon themed wallpaper, which you can also check out below!
