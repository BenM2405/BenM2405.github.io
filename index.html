            <p> 
            Hey! Hope you're doing awesome, I'm Ben! I am currently enrolled at UCSD as a student in Mathematics - Computer Science, 
            and I have been using my time here to learn as much as I can about programming software. 
            I like to workout, read, practice piano and guitar, and most evidently code.
            If you'd like to see what I'm working on, want to check me out on other websites, or learn more about 
            me feel free to check out the links below. Thanks!
            </p>

            <h2> Mootsies <br /> </h2>
            <p> 
            This was my team's contribution to the UCSD Video Game Development Club's Spring 2025 Tritonware
            GameJam! I programmed the puzzle mechanics, UI, and scripts for seamless transitions between the
            story and the game itself. I also worked on some of the art, like the background of the photo
            pictured right. If you want to check out the game for yourself you can play it in your browser through
            the link below!

            <h2> DS3 DataHacks 2025 <br /> </h2>
            <p> 
                DataHacks 2025 was a hackathon hosted by UCSD's Data Science Student Society (DS3). I worked on a team with my friends Teo and 
                Arnav, where we fed Pok√©mon soundtracks and their real-world counterparts into the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) to analyze 
                how much the composers drew from the regions that inspired the games. I compiled all the soundtracks and music, and built the 
                frontend using Streamlit to present our project. You can check out the project at the link below!

            <h2> Incessant <br /> </h2>
            <p>
                We created Incessant during a 48-hour game jam, with the theme "<i>On Repeat</i>". We leaned into the idea of repetition by
                creating a game that reflects the monotony of office life, with each in-game day presenting the same routine, with a new task
                layered in daily. I worked on both the programming and art alongside Teo who contributed to the music and art as well as Arnav
                who contributed to the programming. You can check out our game below!

            <h2> Mental Crash <br /> </h2>
            <p> 
            This game started as a final project assignment for a high school class. As I got more invested, I ended up developing a demo with 
            my own original sprites, art, story, and of course code. You can check out the game for yourself through the link below.

            <h2> Contributions to Wallpaper Engine <br /> </h2>
            <p>
            After using wallpaper engine for about a year I wanted to make my own interactive 
            wallpaper to contribute to the community. I ended up designing a free one based
            around a web series called "ENA" which received 500+ unique downloads! It includes a toggle for 
            the date, time, an audio visualizer, and a few different gifs you can cycle through. I also
            recently created a Pokemon themed wallpaper, which you can also check out below!
